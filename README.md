## About Project
The Clinic Management System program is designed to integrate various clinic functions into a single, user-friendly platform with the aim of improving operational efficiency and service quality. With the Clinic Management System, patient information can be accessed quickly and accurately. This project focuses on the use of data structures and algorithms, utilizing Python as the programming language and SQLite as the database. The data structures used in this program include lists and "ttk.treeview" from the Tkinter module. Lists are used to store collections of elements with different data types in a specific order, and trees represent hierarchical data structures that allow data to be displayed and managed in a table format. The algorithms used are the sorting algorithm (quick sort) and the search algorithm (linear search). Quick Sort is employed to sort data based on the column selected by the user, while Linear Search is a simple search algorithm that examines each element in a list or array one by one, starting from the beginning until the desired element is found or all elements have been checked.

The Clinic Management System program is developed by integrating Python's graphical user interface (GUI) with a database. It includes several features such as an admin panel, a dashboard containing options like insert patient, update patient, delete patient, display, and log out. In the admin panel, the administrator inputs a UserID and password, then clicks the login button to enter the Patient Information Home Page upon successful login. The Insert Patient menu allows the administrator to add patient information, which is integrated into the PatientInformation database. The Update Patient menu is designed to update patient information, where the administrator inputs the patient ID, and the system retrieves patient data from the PatientInformation database, allowing the admin to update the details. The Delete Patient menu grants the administrator authority to remove patient identity information by inputting the patient ID, which displays the patient's details, and clicking the 'Delete' button will remove the information from the database. The Display menu allows the administrator to view all data clearly, sort the data by specific columns such as ID, name, birthdate, and more, and quickly find specific information among the patient data using the 'Search' button. The Log Out function is responsible for ending the current session for the administrator.
